# Tests

This document provides information on how to run and understand the tests for the MultiPartQuizApp.

## Running All Tests

Execute the following command from the project root directory to run all tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s test
```
````

## Test Coverage

- **test_user.py**: Tests for user registration, login, and attempt tracking.
- **test_exam.py**: Tests for starting exams, time management, and question processing.
- **test_question.py**: Tests for question management.
- **test_integration.py**: Tests interactions between modules to ensure complete workflow validation.

## Understanding Test Results

- **Pass**: Indicates that the functionality is working as expected.
- **Fail**: Indicates that there's an issue with the functionality being tested.
- **Error**: Indicates that an unexpected issue occurred during testing.

## Adding New Tests

1. **Create a New Test File:**

   - Follow the naming convention `test_<module>.py`.
   - Place the test file within the `test/` directory.

2. **Write Test Cases:**

   - Use the `unittest` framework to write test cases.
   - Ensure each test case is isolated and independent.

3. **Run the Tests:**

   - Use the command mentioned above to execute the new tests along with existing ones.

## Best Practices for Testing

- **Isolate Tests:** Ensure that each test case is independent of others.
- **Use Mock Data:** Avoid relying on real data; use mock data to simulate different scenarios.
- **Coverage:** Strive for high test coverage to ensure all functionalities are tested.
- **Continuous Integration:** Integrate tests into a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing on commits.
